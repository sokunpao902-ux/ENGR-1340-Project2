Team 13


Tech Labs is a website designed to help Students learn, grow, and connect with others. Additionally, it allows companies to find potential employees that fit the skills they need.

Some of its features include: 

    - Micro-Tasks: a way for students to get real experience and get paid a fee. For companies, it allows them to get simple tasks done and make more people familiar with work in the company.

    - Community: a way for students to interact with fellow students as well as companies. Companies get to reach out to any student they think would fit their company.

    - Courses: Video tutorials as well as live tutoring to help students learn skills they need.
    
    - Success tools: Tools that allows companies to filter through data to find the best possible candidate. For students, it allows them to filter through data to find companies that are likely to hire them.


Due to the project only needing 5 pages, only the Micro-Tasks and Community pages have been implemented so far.
